""" 
In python 2.x the above examples using items would return a list with tuples containing the copied key-value pairs of the dictionary. 
In order to not copy and with that load the whole dictionaryâ€™s keys and values inside a list to the memory 
you should prefer the iteritems method which simply returns an iterator instead of a list. 
In Python 3.x the iteritems is removed and the items method returns view objects. 
The benefit of these view objects compared to the tuples containing copies is that every change made to the dictionary is reflected in the view objects.
